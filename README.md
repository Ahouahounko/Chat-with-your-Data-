# Chat-with-your-Data-
5 steps to chat with your own data via  Langchain, ChatGPT..


## Overview

In this tutorial, we'll use Langchain and GPT to learn how to communicate with our own external information sources.
We'll agree on the use of RetrievalQA and the conversational retrieval chain, and specifically on the types of chains ( stuff, map-reduce, refine, map_rerank,...). 
With all this, our goal of communication(question-answers) is achieved via the #ChatOpenAI usage.
